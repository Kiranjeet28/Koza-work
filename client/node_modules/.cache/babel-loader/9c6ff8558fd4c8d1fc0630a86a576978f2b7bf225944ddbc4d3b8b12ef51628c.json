We're not talking about the little dark or red marks that go away with time, exfoliation, and scar facing spot treatments. Instead, we're talking about atrophic scarring—aka indented scars that form below the upper layer of skin tissue as a result of severe acne that prevents the skin from being able to regenerate tissue correctly, leaving behind uneven texture in shapes known as ice-pick, rolling, and boxcar scars.</div><br><div>Acne like cysts or nodules which are considered to be “inflammatory acne”, lead to long-term scarring because they penetrate beneath the upper layer of the skin. </div><br> <div>Some individuals are more prone to acne scars compared to others because of picking/touching, ignoring acne treatment and also because of genetics.

They appear like tiny dot-like depressions, a little bigger than the size of our hair follicles, but covering it up is the most challenging task for dermatologists.</li><br><li>Raised Acne Scars– These scars are not as prevalent as depressed scars.
